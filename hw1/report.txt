Q: What's the best-case, worst-case, and average-case time complexities of quicksort.
   Briefly explain each case.

   Ans: the best-case is all have been sorted which complexities is O(nlogn)
        the average-case complexities is O(nlogn)
        the worst-case is the sort is all reversed which complexities is O(n^2)


Q: What's the best-case, worst-case, and average-case time complexities? Briefly explain.(qselect)

    Ans: the best-case is we pick the pivot which is the target number then the complexities is O(n)
         the average-case complexities is also O(n)
         the worst-case is we pick to the last pivot then the complexities is O(n^2)

Q: What are the time complexities for the operations implemented?

    Ans: Sorted function should be O(nlogn)
         insert function should be O(nlogn)
         search function should be O(nlogn)
