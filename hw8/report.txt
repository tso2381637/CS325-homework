0. For the following graphs, decide whether they are
   (1) directed or undirected, (2) dense or sparse, and (3) cyclic or acyclic:

   (a) Facebook                                               undirected,sparse,acyclic
   (b) Twitter                                                un/directed,sparse,acyclic
   (c) a family                                               undirected,dense,acyclic
   (d) V=airports, E=direct_flights                           directed,sparse,acyclic
   (e) a mesh                 
   (f) V=courses, E=prerequisites                             directed,sparse,acyclic
   (g) a tree                                                 directed,sparse,acyclic
   (h) V=linux_software_packages, E=dependencies              directed,sparse,acyclic
   (i) DP subproblems for 0-1 knapsack                        directed,sparse,acyclic

   Can you name a very big dense graph?

1. 
   (a) did you realize that bottom-up implementations of DP use (implicit) topological orderings?
       e.g., what is the topological ordering in your (or my) bottom-up bounded knapsack code?

       the list of item be taked 

   (b) what about top-down implementations? what order do they use to traverse the graph?



   (c) does that suggest there is a top-down solution for topological sort as well?
