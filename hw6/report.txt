	(a) pick the most valueable
	(b) 
	(c) f(w) = opt(w-wi) +v_i
	(d) for i to n
	(e) opt[w] = 0
	(f) time complexities O(nw), speace complexities O(n)

2. Bounded Knapsack
	(a) take them all
	(b) 
	(c) f(w) = max(opt[w-wi][i-1]+vi,opt[w][i-1])

	(e) opt[0][i] = 0, opt[w][0] =0
	(f) time complexities O(nw), speace complexities O(nw)
